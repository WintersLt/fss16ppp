##A Discriminative Model Approach for Accurate Duplicate Bug Report Retrieval##

### Keywords

#### ii1) Motivational Statement:
Automating triaging has been proved challenging as two reports
of the same bug could be written in various ways. There is
still much room for improvement in terms of accuracy of du-
plicate detection process. In this paper, we leverage recent
advances on using discriminative models for information re-
trieval to detect duplicate bug reports more accurately.

### iii4) Baseline results:
We have validated our approach on three large software bug
repositories from Firefox, Eclipse, and OpenOffice. We show
that our technique could result in 17–31%, 22–26%, and 35–
43% relative improvement over state-of-the-art techniques in
OpenOffice, Firefox, and Eclipse datasets respectively using
commonly available natural language information only.
